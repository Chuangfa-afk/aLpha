# aLpha

**Have you ever missed a deadline?** Juggling all of those college assignments can be quite a hassle. 
Introducing **aLpha**, a planner system tailor-made for SBU students.

## 🌟 Inspiration
Our drive to dive into this Hackathon was our passion for new challenges. As first-timers creating a Google Chrome extension, 
we strived to do our best within the short span of 24 hours. We wanted to craft something genuinely helpful for individuals, 
especially students akin to us. Through a quick survey among Stony Brook University students, we discovered that a significant 
number faced academic setbacks due to accidentally missing assignment deadlines. From the myriad of ideas brainstormed, 
aLpha emerged as our solution.

## 🛠️ What it does
aLpha isn't just a tool – it's your academic companion. With a single click on the 'aLpha' icon, students gain immediate 
insights into impending assignment deadlines. This extension efficiently retrieves all upcoming assignments from Blackboard, 
sorting them according to your preferences. You can even manually integrate your tasks into the planner. And there’s more! 
aLpha also offers quick navigation to various crucial SBU websites like SBU Solar, Degree Works, and Campus Printer.

## 🏗️ How we built it
Armed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we embarked on our coding marathon. Settled in the library, we plunged into the
exhilarating world of coding. While crafting the extension demo was a challenging feat, the journey was thoroughly enjoyable.

## ❗ Challenges we ran into
Breaking out of our comfort zones, we ventured into unfamiliar programming territories, which posed its own set of trials. 
Our knowledge was primarily limited to Python, Java, and Ocaml. During the coding process, we stumbled upon a content security 
policy issue with Chrome, which took us a significant time to troubleshoot.

## 🎉 Accomplishments that we're proud of
After 18 relentless hours, we birthed our first creation, **aLpha**! The final demo surpassed our expectations. 
We genuinely believe that aLpha has the potential to aid SBU students in elevating their academic performance. 
Moreover, as developers, aLpha stands testament to our ability to innovate under time constraints.

## 📚 What we learned
Maintaining a unified vision (the *What*) while harboring diverse strategies (the *How*) is paramount. 
Our collective vision aimed to create a tool beneficial to SBU students. Our diverse strategies manifested 
as a plethora of ideas, from which we cherry-picked the best to implement.

## 🚀 What's next for aLpha
The adrenaline-pumping experience of crafting this project was a unique one. Racing against time while ideating 
rapidly was both a challenge and a delight. We're optimistic about aLpha's potential impact and can't wait to see where this journey takes us.
